# PythonUtilities
Python scripts to automate utility functions which help in development work. Developed in Python 3.7.4.

## Python packages
These scripts make use of glob, shutil.

1. The script [main_rename_files_00.py](https://github.com/AshivDhondea/PythonUtilities/blob/master/main_rename_files_00.py) renames files from a directory by removing all occcurrences of a chosen string in the file names and copying the renamed files in another directory. This is useful when importing figures in LaTeX which does not accept file names with spaces and underscores.

2. The script [main_get_script_name.py](https://github.com/AshivDhondea/PythonUtilities/blob/master/main_get_script_name.py) finds the file name of the script. This is useful when you want to name output files according to the script which created them.
